	abstract = {The Eurasian ice sheet complex (EIS) was the third largest ice sheet complex at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Although temporal and spatial evolution of the EIS during the last glacial cycle has not been well-established, strong evidence indicates the existence of nearly ice-free conditions during Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3). Between MIS 3 and the LGM, the EIS likely experienced substantial expansions. These expansions were accompanied by decreasing boreal summer insolation, a slight reduction in greenhouse gases, and millennial-scale abrupt shifts between stadial and interstadial conditions. Using the state-of-the-art Earth system model AWI-ESM with asynchronously coupled dynamic ice sheets, we performed transient simulations focusing on this period. Our study shows that the formation of the EIS resembles a bifurcation transition. Only in case of a relatively weak background Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a sufficiently large thin ice/snow cover develops to accommodate a subsequent ice volume growth as Northern Hemisphere summer insolation further decreases. Furthermore, sensitivity experiments show a large non-linearity in surface mass balance changes in response to varying temperature and precipitation, indicating a high sensitivity of the EIS buildup. Our study highlights the large complexity and strong non-linearity of the Earth system induced by internal climate feedbacks, particularly the interactions between ice sheets and other climate components.},

    abstract = {Previous modelling efforts have investigated climate responses to different Milankovitch forcing during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 13. During this time the climate has been highly variable at atmospheric CO2 concentrations of $\sim$240 ppm. As yet, ice sheet-climate feedbacks were missing in previous studies. Therefore we use the state-of-the-art coupled climate-ice sheet model, AWI-ESM-1.2, to investigate the MIS-13 climate and corresponding Northern Hemisphere ice sheet (NHIS) evolution by performing simulations under three different astronomical configurations representing 495, 506 and 517 kyr BP. The simulated excess ice compared to present-day is mainly over the Cordillera, Arctic islands and Tibet. The global mean surface air temperature for the MIS-13 experiments have the same magnitude. At 506 kyr BP with boreal summer at perihelion, the Northern Hemisphere continents are warmer during summer than the other experiments, which could potentially inhibit the development of the ice sheets. The Cordilleran Ice Sheet is found to be especially sensitive to orbital (precession) forcing, at an intermediate CO2 level. This is probably due to its high elevation where the freezing point could be easily maintained. The other ice sheets over northeast America and Eurasia, however, are absent in our simulations. We propose that the alpine-based Cordilleran Ice Sheet is more sensitive and easier to build up than other NHISs in response to the astronomical controlled summer insolation. Dynamic surges are simulated for the Cordilleran Ice Sheet under fixed low orbital forcing. These surges due to internal ice sheet-climate feedbacks could potentially be the mechanism for the millennial scale H-like events.},

Various studies have been conducted to uncover the physical mechanism behind them, based on the assumption that climate mean state determines the variability. However, our study shows that the Dansgaard-Oeschger events can regulate the mean state of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets. Sensitivity experiments show that the simulated mean state is influenced by the amplitude of the climatic noise. The most likely cause of this phenomenon is the nonlinear response of the surface mass balance to temperature. It could also cause the retreat processes to be faster than the buildup processes within a glacial cycle. We propose that the climate variability hindered ice sheet development and prevented the Earth system from entering a full glacial state from Marine Isotope Stage 4 to Marine Isotope Stage 3 about 60,000 years ago.},

By comparing the simulated results to geological reconstructions, we first show that the modelled climate is capable of capturing the main features of the ice-sheet evolution. However, large deviations exist, likely due to the absence of nonlinear interactions between ice sheet and other climate components. The model uncertainties of the climate forcing are examined using the output from nine climate models from the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase III. The results show a large variability in simulated ice sheets between the different models. We find that the ice-sheet extent pattern resembles summer surface air temperature pattern at the Last Glacial Maximum, confirming the dominant role of surface ablation process for high-latitude Northern Hemisphere ice sheets. This study shows the importance of the upper boundary condition for ice-sheet modelling, and implies that careful constraints on climate output is essential for simulating realistic glacial Northern Hemisphere ice sheets.},

Our results, derived from a two end-member mixing model based on δ13C values of bulk OC, revealed that OCterr dominates (∼74 %) the sedimentary OC in both areas, with OCmar contributing ∼26 %. The HMA exhibited OCterr and OCmar contents ∼5 times higher than in the sandy areas. Both OCterr and OCmar loadings negatively correlated with mean grain size, indicating reduced OC degradation in muddy sediments. Molecular analysis further revealed that OCterr in the HMA is less refractory compared to adjacent sandy regions. These differences are attributed to differences in porewater transport, oxygen penetration depths and exposure times, all of which influence OC preservation, despite the important role of mineral protection. OCterr and OCmar accumulation fluxes in the HMA were calculated at (6.75 ± 0.61) × 10−3 and (2.54 ± 0.68) × 10−3 Tg C/yr, respectively, representing 34.3 % of OCterr export from adjacent rivers and 2.8 % of net OCmar production in the HMA. These values are twice the global average for shelf areas, highlighting the exceptional efficiency of the HMA as a carbon sink and hinting at the significance of small-size depocenters within sandy areas in the global carbon cycle.},

Higher-resolution models substantially improve AMO simulations, closely matching observed periods and amplitudes, yet the reason for the improvement remains unclear. Here, using 4 experiments conducted within the Alfred Wegener Institute Climate Model with different atmospheric and oceanic resolutions, we found that models with a high-resolution ocean capture the positive feedback between the AMO and the Fram Strait sea ice export mediated by the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation through a more realistic simulation of North Atlantic currents, extending the AMO period to 40 to 80 years. Further increasing the atmospheric resolution results in an AMO amplitude closer to observations due to stronger coupling between atmospheric blocking and Arctic sea ice. This indicates the importance of higher resolution in models for simulating the interaction between synoptic-scale atmospheric processes and long-term ocean variability, which is crucial for AMO simulations.},

Here, we reconstruct subarctic humidity changes over the past 400 kyr to investigate the role of low-to-high latitude interactions in regulating Arctic hydroclimate. Our reconstruction is based on precipitation-driven sediment input variations in the Subarctic North Pacific (SANP), which reveal a strong precessional cycle in subarctic humidity under the relatively low eccentricity variations that dominated the past four glacial-interglacial cycles. Combined with climate model simulations, we highlight that precession drives meridional shifts in the northern rim of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) and modulates the efficiency of heat and water vapor transfer to the SANP and Arctic regions. Our findings suggest that projections of a northward shift of the NPSG in response to future global warming will lead to wetter conditions in the Arctic Ocean and enhanced sea-ice loss.},

Basal motion is accomplished via the deformation of unconsolidated sediments, or via sliding of the ice over an undeformable bed. We present an ice sheet sliding module for the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) that takes into account changes in sediment cover and incorporates surface meltwater. This model routes meltwater, produced at the surface and base of the ice sheet, toward the margin of the ice sheet. Basal sliding is accomplished through the deformation of water saturated sediments, or sliding at the ice-bed interface. In areas with continuous, water saturated sediments, sliding is almost always accomplished through sediment deformation. In areas with incomplete cover, sliding has a stronger dependence on the supply of water. We find that the addition of surface meltwater to the base is a more important factor for ice sheet evolution than the style of sliding. In a glacial cycle simulation, our model causes a more rapid buildup of the Laurentide Ice Sheet.},

Here, we present very well-dated and high-resolution records from the eastern Labrador Sea representing the last 19.000 years, which demonstrate abrupt changes in sea surface characteristics. Four millennial-scale meltwater events have been identified between the last 14.000 and 8.200 years based on independent biomarker proxies and X-ray fluorescence scanning data. These events are characterized by increased sea ice formation and decreased sea surface temperatures which might have occurred within a few decades. We propose these abrupt changes were triggered by meltwater pulsing into the Labrador Sea periodically, resulting from collapse of the Laurentide-Greenland Ice Sheets caused by (sub-)surface ocean warming in the Labrador Sea. Our findings provide more precise information about impact of freshwater forcing on abrupt climate changes, which may help to improve simulations for past and future changes in ocean circulation and climate.},

The impact of paleoclimate, especially Holocene climate, on the present and future evolution of the GrIS is explored. Our simulations of the past show close agreement with reconstructions with respect to the recent timing of the peaks in ice volume and the climate of Greenland. The maximum and minimum ice volume at around 18–17 ka and 6–5 ka lag the respective extremes in climate by several thousand years, implying that the ice volume response of the GrIS strongly lags climatic changes. Given that Greenland’s climate was getting colder from the Holocene Thermal Maximum (i.e., 8 ka) to the Pre-Industrial era, our simulation implies that the GrIS experienced growth from the mid-Holocene to the industrial era. Due to this background trend, the GrIS still gains mass until the second half of the 20th century, even though anthropogenic warming begins around 1850 AD. This is also in agreement with observational evidence showing mass loss of the GrIS does not begin earlier than the late 20th century. Our results highlight that the present evolution of the GrIS is not only controlled by the recent climate changes, but is also affected by paleoclimate, especially the relatively warm Holocene climate. We propose that the GrIS was not in equilibrium throughout the entire Holocene and that the slow response to Holocene climate needs to be represented in ice sheet simulations in order to predict ice mass loss, and therefore sea level rise, accurately.},

The first dataset includes the distribution of surficial sediments, which is separated into continuous, discontinuous and predominantly rock categories. The second dataset includes sediment grain size properties, which is divided into three classes: clay, silt and sand, based on the dominant grain size of the fine fraction of the glacial sediments. The third dataset is the generalized bedrock geology. We demonstrate the utility of these datasets for governing ice sheet dynamics by using an ice sheet model with a simulation that extends through the last glacial cycle. In order to demonstrate the importance of the basal boundary conditions for ice sheet modelling, we changed the shear friction angle to account for a weaker substrate and found changes up to 40 % in ice thickness compared to a reference run.
