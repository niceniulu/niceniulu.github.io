### **Welcome!**
<br>


##### **Biography**

My primary research interests focus on paleoclimate dynamics, ice sheet dynamics, and the interactions between ice sheets and climate across multiple timescales. Using comprehensive Earth system models as the main research tool, I investigate the mechanisms driving Earth system changes, with a particular emphasis on nonlinear feedbacks among ice sheets, the ocean, and the atmosphere.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Paleoclimate Dynamics Section at the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) in Germany, working with Prof. Dr. Gerrit Lohmann, Dr. Gregor Knorr, and colleagues. I received my Ph.D. in 2019 from the University of Bremen (Faculty 1 - Physics/Electrical Engineering), under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Gerrit Lohmann](https://paleodyn.uni-bremen.de/gl/).

##### **Research interests**

- paleoclimate dynamics
- ice sheet/glacier dynamics
- nonlinear feedbacks between ice sheets and other climate components
